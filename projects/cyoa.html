            <h4>Context:</h4>
            <p>For our CYOA project, we were tasked with creating an interactive story where the player makes choices that affect the outcome. My partners and I decided to make a murder mystery game, where the player takes on the role of a detective trying to solve a case, and the goal was to make a fun and engaging experience.</p>
            <h4>Content:</h4>
            <p>To create our game, we used CS50.dev and Github to organize and manage our files. The game works by presenting the player with different choices each leading to new clues, suspects, or dead ends. For example, "Is it Tom That Murdered Timothy" or "The Mayor Murdered Timothy"? Each choice takes them to new file with questions, answers, and more other decisions. The goal is to solve the mystery by making the right choices.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Challenges:</h4>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges were making sure all the choices were connected properly. Since we were working with multiple files, we had to be careful of how linked each file to another file. Debugging was also the problem because if one click didn't work, then it wouldn't lead to the next scene or the next step.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Takeaways:</h4>
            <p>We learned a lot of file organization, linking files to other files, and structuring the game. This project helped us understand how small mistakes in file management can affect the end result of the game, and it also showed us how useful github is for collaboration.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Next Steps:</h4>
            <p>If I knew how to plan this out sooner and understood the concept, I would have finished the work quickly as possible and improve the game by adding images and sounds to make it even more engaging. We could also expand the story with more enaging choice and alternative endings to make the mystery more complex.</p>
