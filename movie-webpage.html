            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>For this project, my partner and I wanted to explore the idea of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and its possible effects on humanity in the future. We decided to create an interactive website to ask people, "What if A.I. became too powerful? Could it end up controlling our lives?" The goal was to present both sides of the issue showing how A.I. could help society, but also warning about the potential dangers if it got too advanced. We wanted to get people thinking about whether humanity could outsmart A.I. or if A.I. would eventually be in charge.</p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>For this project, my partner and I decided to create an interactive website exploring the idea of Humanity vs A.I. We wanted to get people thinking about whether A.I. could one day become too powerful and take control, or if humanity could stay in charge. We built a simple webpage using HTML and CSS, where we included a fictional story about A.I. starting to take over, and a section where visitors could type in their opinion on whether A.I. or humans should have control. The website was designed to be fun and interactive, with images of robots</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges was making sure the website looked good and was easy to use. We wanted the text to be readable, the images to look nice, and everything to be organized. It took a few of trial and error to get everything to look right on the page, but we learned a lot about design and coding as we went. We had some trouble with the code itself. For example, getting the images to appear correctly and making sure everything was aligned properly took a little bit of time. </p>
